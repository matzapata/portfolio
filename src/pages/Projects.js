                <p>Devjet is a website that helps web developers build faster by providing code recipes and generators to work with PERN or NEXTJS stacks. Iâ€™ve worked building the website from scratch with nextjs, typescript, chakraui, MDX, supabase and deployed it on vercel. The CLI that generates code is build with typescript and gluegun. I currently work writing posts and code generators as content for it.</p>
